	<h1>Common Errors in Bibliographies <span class="accent">John Owens</span></h1>

	<p>First: Issues in text: how to cite properly.</p>

	<ol>

	  <li><p><b>Citations as words</b>: Huge pet peeve: Using
	      citations as words. van Leunen: “Brackets
	      are not words. A bracketed number is just a pointer, not
	      a word. Never, ever, use a bracketed number as if it
	      were the name of an author or a work.” (p. 20). So
	      instead of “A similar strategy is described in
	      [15].”), use instead “A similar strategy is
	      discussed by AuthorOne et al. [15]”.

	      The way you can get this right in your head is
	      considering a journal that does citations as
	      superscripts (like the old Graphics Hardware style). It
	      looks really stupid to say “A similar strategy is
	      discussed by <sup>15</sup>.” I don't like this
	      particular style for citation, but it does make sure
	      citations aren't used as words.
	  </p></li>

	  <li><p><b>Citing with LaTeX</b>: When writing citations in
	      LaTeX, do them in this form:</p>

	    <div id="onecolwide">
	      <p><tt>text text text~\cite{Foo:2000:BAR}</tt></p></div>

	    <p>The ~ means non-breaking space (which is what you
	      want—you don't want a linebreak between the text and
	      the
	      citation).</p>

	    <p>Also,
	      do</p>	    <div id="onecolwide">
	      <p> <tt>\cite{AuthorOne:2000:ABC,AuthorTwo:2002:DEF}</tt></p></div>
	    <p>instead of</p>
	    <div id="onecolwide">
	      <p><tt>\cite{AuthorOne:2000:ABC}\cite{AuthorTwo:2002:DEF}.</tt></p></div>

	    <p>Always alphabetize grouped citations so they
	      appear in numerical order (instead of [8, 6, 10],
	      arrange the citations so it looks like [6, 8,
	      10]). <tt>\usepackage{cite}</tt> supposedly puts them in
	      proper order for you automatically (!) and also changes
	      [1,2,3,4,6] to [1–4,6] which is handy.</p></li>

	  <li><p><b>Shortcite</b>: Use <tt>\shortcite</tt> when
	      appropriate. <tt>\shortcite</tt> is used in sentences
	      like “AuthorOne discusses this point further in
	      her dissertation [AuthorOne 2002].” It looks silly
	      to put AuthorOne's name twice. Instead,
	      use <tt>\shortcite{AuthorOne:2002:AOT}</tt>, which makes
	      the sentence “AuthorOne discusses this point
	      further in her dissertation [2002].” Of course
	      this only makes sense if you are using a citation format
	      that lists author name / year (like Siggraph or most
	      dissertation formats).
	    </p>

	    <p>I always use <tt>\shortcite</tt> in my text even when
	      my bib style doesn't support it, in which case I use the
	      following fix in my LaTeX preamble (this
	      defines <tt>\shortcite</tt> if it's not already defined,
	      otherwise it has no effect):</p>

	    <div id="onecolwide">
	      <p><tt>\providecommand{\shortcite}[1]{\cite{#1}}</tt></p>
	    </div>

	    <p>If you don't have this command, you'll see an error
	      like:</p>

	    <div id="onecolwide">
	      <p><tt>! Undefined control sequence.<br>
		  l.123 ...blah blah Author1 and Author2~\shortcite
                  {Author1:1999:ABC} blah...</tt></p></div></li>

	  <li><p><b>Sorting your references</b>: If at all possible,
	      arrange your reference list in
    	      alphabetical order by author's last name. Going in cited
	      order is much less useful to readers of your paper. The
	      only reason I've heard that cited-order is useful is in
	      a survey article where nearby (and presumably related)
	      citations from the paper are next to each other in the
	      bibliography. I don't find this argument particularly
	      compelling.
	  </p></li>

	</ol>

	<p>Next: issues with bibliographies (your .bib file). Big
	  picture: Don't trust the digital library to give you a perfect
	  .bib file. Both ACM and IEEE (as well as many others) screw up
	  bibliography entries in delightfully creative ways.</p>

	<ol>

	  <li><p><b>Names</b>: Make the names in the bibliography
	      match what is printed on the paper. If the paper
	      has <tt>First M. Last</tt> as the author, put that in
	      your bibliography. If it has initials, use those. If it
	      has crazy umlauts and accents, use those too. If it has
	      initials, make sure they are separated by spaces:
	      use <tt>J. D. Owens</tt> rather than <tt>J.D.
		Owens</tt>. The latter leads bibtex to believe the first
	      name is <tt>J.D.</tt> with no middle name/initial. (And
	      then if your bibstyle abbreviates first names, you'll
	      just get the initial <tt>J.</tt> without the middle
	      initial, since bibtex doesn't think you have a middle
	      name.)</p>

	    <p>For hyphenated names with the second half uncapitalized
	      (Wu-chun Feng, Wen-mei Hwu), put the hyphen and second
	      half in brackets: <tt>Wu-{chun} Feng</tt>, <tt>Wen{-mei}
	        Hwu</tt>.</p>

	  </li>

	  <li><p><b>Capitalization in titles</b>: Just like with
	      authors, the capitalization on titles in your bibtex file
	      should match what's on the paper. <b>The bib
		style should enforce capitalization, not your
		bibliography</b>—your bib should faithfully
	      represent what's printed on the paper. </p>

	    <p>Also, make sure, in your BibTeX file, that you
	      properly bracket <tt>{}</tt> words in titles that must
	      be capitalized, like GPU or PDE, or proper names.
	      Example (the “Loop” should always be
	      capitalized since it's a last name):</p>

	    <div id="onecolwide">
	      <p>
		<tt>
		  @inproceedings{Bischoff:2000:THI,<br>
		  author = "Stephan Bischoff and Leif P. Kobbelt and Hans-Peter Seidel",<br>
		  title = "Towards Hardware Implementation Of {L}oop Subdivision",
		</tt>
	      </p>
	    </div>

	    <p>You don't have to do this with venues (or anything
	      else), just the title.</p>

	    <p>Resist the temptation to double-brace the
	      entire title as a manner of course: <tt>{{Title Title with
		Title}}</tt>. This guarantees your title will always be
	      capitalized. But many bib styles downcase all titles, in
	      which case your title will stick out like a sore thumb.
	      Instead, just put your title in single-braces or quotes
	      and let the bib style do the right thing. </p>

	    <p>(What is the right thing? In the US, publishers
	      capitalize most words in titles [title case]; in the UK,
	      publishers use the same capitalization rules as normal
	      sentences [sentence case].
	      [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case#Headings_and_publication_titles">Wikipedia
		link.</a>] Markus
	      Kuhn's <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/publ-tips/#typography">thoughts
		on the subject</a> are congruent with mine, that sentence
	      case is preferable from an information-theoretic point of
	      view, but in practice, authors should follow the
	      conventions of their publication venue.)</p>

	    <p>If the title is in all-caps, I usually rewrite it in
	      title case.</p>

	    <p>[ <a href="http://www.tex.ac.uk/cgi-bin/texfaq2html?label=capbibtex">Capitalisation
		in BibTeX, from the TeX FAQ</a> ]</p></li>

	  <li><p><b>Venues</b>: Both ACM and IEEE screw up venue names
	      in
	      different ways. Here's how IEEE formatted a recent venue
	      name in a recent paper of mine:</p>

	    <div id="onecolwide">
	      <p><tt>booktitle={Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV),
		  2011 IEEE},</tt>
	    </p></div>

	    <p><i>Never use the ACM or IEEE digital library's
		citations
		without fixing them.</i> For some reason the First
	      Society of Computing and the World's Largest
	      Professional Association for the Advancement of
	      Technology have zero interest in making their
	      capitalization correct. For instance,
	      the <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=346883&coll=ACM&dl=ACM&CFID=30100801&CFTOKEN=20359021#">first
		paper I ever wrote</a>, according to ACM, has the
	      following title and booktitle:</p>

	    <div id="onecolwide">
	      <p><tt>title =
		  {Polygon rendering on a stream architecture},<br>
		  booktitle = {HWWS '00: Proceedings of the ACM
		  SIGGRAPH/EUROGRAPHICS workshop on Graphics
		  hardware},</tt></p></div>

	    <p>when the paper has the major words in the title
	      capitalized, and “workshop” and
	      “hardware” should both be capitalized in the
	      booktitle. I often review papers where citations have
	      been taken directly from ACM with bizarre capitalization
	      particularly in the booktitle. Fix these before you
	      submit a paper.</p></li>

	  <li><p><b>Months</b>: Include the month of publication
	      in your bibliographies (simply for your own records: when
	      you have two papers talking about a similar idea, one in
	      January and one in November of the same year, maintaining
	      the month lets you determine which came first. </p>

	    <p>Always use three-letter abbreviations without quotes
	      for months. These are built into bibtex. They allow the
	      bib style to actually know what month it is, so the bib
	      style can enforce a consistent style across all
	      citations (1/2012? Jan. 2012? January 2012? Januar 2012
	      [foreign language]?).</p>

	    <div id="onecolwide">
	      <p>
		<tt>
		  month = mar, <span style="color:blue">% most common - single month</span><br>
		  month         = jun # "\slash "  # jul,  <span style="color:blue">% two months</span><br>
		  month         = "18~"  # dec   <span style="color:blue">% day/month</span>
		</tt>
	      </p>
	    </div>

	    <p>Digital libraries often get these wrong (IEEE
	      uses <tt>month={june}</tt>).</p></li>

	  <li><p><b>Pages</b>: Always include pages if pages are
	      available. Ranges of pages use the en-dash to separate
	      them (that's two dashes): <tt>35--49</tt>. Some
	      non-printed proceedings only assign a paper number, so
	      for those I typically see (and use) something
	      like <tt>12:1--12:10</tt>, where <tt>12</tt> is the
	      paper number and the paper has <tt>10</tt> pages.</p>

	    <p>Also, if the bib source says that your paper starts on
	      page 1, double-check it. Make sure that it doesn't list
	      every paper in the conference/journal starting on page 1
	      (like the rocket scientists at IPDPS 2009 who decided it
	      would be a good idea to assign neither page numbers nor
	      paper IDs
	      [<a href="http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/IPDPS.2009.5161065">example</a>]).
	      It's a little embarrassing when you cite two papers in your
	      article and they both start on page 1 of the same
	      conference. (Usually, you should figure out the paper
	      number <tt>n</tt> in the conference and
	      use <tt>n:1--n:10</tt>. If you can't make your page numbers
	      unique, leave them out entirely.)</p></li>

	  <li><p><b>DOIs</b>: DOIs uniquely identify a paper. Even
	      if your style doesn't use them, you should record them
	      in your bibtex file. Store them as the numbers only (DOIs
	      have the
	      format <tt>http://dx.doi.org/numbers/numbers</tt>; store
	      the part after <tt>http://dx.doi.org/</tt> only).
	      Bibliography tools seem to use this format predominantly.</p></li>

	  <li><p><b>URLs</b>: If you're putting a URL into your bibliography,
	      wrap it in <tt>\url{}</tt> (and
	      put <tt>\usepackage{url}</tt> in your LaTeX preamble) so
	      it wraps nicely. If you add a DOI with a <tt>doi</tt>
	      tag, you don't need to add the DOI as <tt>url</tt> as
	      well.</p></li>

	</ol>

	  wrong! Corrections are in blue.</p>
